# GoogleGlass-FakeWebsite
This was my first website developed with HTML, CSS and a few JS code.

## What is it?
This website was one of the first pages created by me in 2013, it is a fake website about Google Glass. 
It's content as video, photo, text, etc... was copied from some websites on Google and translated to Portuguese.

## How does it work?
That's simple! It's designed in five parts:

### 1º: HOME
Here you can get a lot of information about Google Glass, such as the latest news, release date, technical specifications, how it works and what you can do with it. There also are two videos, enjoy!

### 2º: ESPECIFICAÇÕES
A Google Glass schema will show the key technical parts and how to use them. I did it with "iframe", so just click on the red surface and the iframe turns the text.
